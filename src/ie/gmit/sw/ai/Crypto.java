/**
 * Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure
 * communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More
 * generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that
 * prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various
 * aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity,
 * authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography.
